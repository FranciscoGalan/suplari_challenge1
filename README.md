# Suplari Data Exercise
There is no specific timing on this or constraints. If you have any questions about the specific data sets or exercise, *we highly encourage you to ask*. Take a look at the data and let us know what you think. Suplari's wedge strategy is to build better spend analytics capabilities that leverage  machine learning to deliver customer insights. However, the day-to-day  work in the early days involves helping customers get data out of their  financial systems, **getting that data into Suplari**, and then  finding insights. The data analyst role is key in building and  maintaining a master supplier data set which acts as the ground truth  for our data science team and is used by the product and customers.



Attached are data files from a fictitious company called Tech Trades. The  2015-2017 p-card data files contain procurement or payment card  transactions for the 2015-2017 years. For each transaction, there should be a cost center, account code (expense type), and business unit. The  BUs, CCs, and Account mapping to names/text are all in the other three  files.



The goal of the exercise is as follows:

1) What are the top 10 suppliers for 2017 and how much is spent on each supplier?

2) Which business unit was the top spender so far in 2017?

3) Compare the top 10 suppliers in 2017 to the top suppliers in 2016

4) How many transactions were recorded for 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively?



The data is certainly not clean, so please feel free to reach out to us, with any questions. We ask that you use **Python 3+** to complete the exercise so we can get a sense of your skills there, as  our Data Analysts frequently use Python for data cleaning. When you are  finished, please reply to all of us with your answers.
